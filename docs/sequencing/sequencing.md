2. Kneeling
3. Prone
4. Kneeling
5. Standing
6. Kneeling
7. Prone (optional)
8. Supine (Required for all seated)
9. Seated (Kneeling, standing, prone and supine are required)
10. Supine 

## Changing Directions of the spine

Forward Bends are the hub of the wheel. 

Twist <-> Forward Bend <-> Backbend \\
Lateral Bend  <-> Forward Bend <-> Twist \\
Backbend <-> Forward Bend <-> Twist 

There should always be a [Forward Bend](/yoga/docs/asanas/forward-bends/forward-bends/) between [Lateral Bends](), [Backbends]() and [Twists](). This helps protect the back between twists, backbend and lateral bend.
